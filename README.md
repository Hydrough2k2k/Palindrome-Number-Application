# Palindrome Number Calculator Application
Palindrome Number Calculator - A program to generate symmetrical numbers

Inspired by Numberphile, they made an excellent video about palindromic numbers, check it out!

# Download the app [here](https://github.com/Hydrough2k2k/Palindrome-Number-Application/raw/main/Palindrome%20Calculator.exe)

Using this application you can generate palindrome numbers by repeatedly reversing and adding a number. It is theorised that all numbers will become palindromic eventually using this method. Using this application you can test any number up to 18 digits. You can also test a range of numbers and see what they return

# Features

The biggest number this program can generate is ~603 million digits long, but realisically you'll never get there with this version of the program. Later updates will fix that

You can customise many things in the application, maxtimum runtime, maximum number length, displayed information and many more.
There is a local config file for storing settings and you can save calculations and resume them later

If you would like an interesting starting seed, use 196, 295, 394 or 493. There are many others that might grow infinitely (theoretically), feel free to test any number!

# Feedback

If you have any questions or feedback let me know! I still have a bucketlist for what features I would like to add.

# About the app

To run the application you need to download and run the exe file or click the link above.
It will create a small folder structure where the exe is located. Config.txt is the local configuration file. Manually editing it might cause some strange behaviour

You can also compile the application from the source code I provided in anything that supports GCC, for example Visual Studio.

# Compatibility:

Windows 10 64 bit, Windows 11 64 bit

There is no 32 bit version yet and no port for Linux and Mac OS
