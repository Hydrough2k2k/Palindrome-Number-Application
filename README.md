# Palindrome-Number-Application
Palindrome Number Calculator - A program to generate symmetrical numbers

Using this application you can generate palindrome numbers by repeatedly reversing and adding a number. It is theorised that all numbers will become palindromic eventually using this method. Using this application you can test any number up to 18 digits.

The biggest number this program can generate is ~600 million digits long, but realisically you'll never get there with this version of the program. Later updates will fix that

If you would like an interesting starting seed, use 196, 296, 394 or 493. There are many others that might grow to infinity (theoretically), feel free to test any number!

If you have any questions or feedback let me know! I still have a bucket list for what features I would like to add.
